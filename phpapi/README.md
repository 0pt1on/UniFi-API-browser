## UniFi controller API client class

This directory contains a PHP class, which is based off the work of @domwo and @fbagnol and the API shell client as published by UBNT.

If you plan to create your own PHP code levering the UniFi controller API, it is recommended to use the standalone version of the API client class which can be found here: https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client
